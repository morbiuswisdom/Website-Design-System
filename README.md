# Website-Design-System
A comprehensive, evolving design system built with HTML and CSS, featuring modern color palettes, clear typography, and scalable patterns for web projects. This is Version 1.0, currently focused on layout, colors, and typography, with interactivity (such as live color pickers and component demos) planned for future releases as JavaScript is learned and integrated.

## Color Palette
- 7-tone Grayscale and vibrant color system for Primary, Success, Warning, and Danger, with logical spacing for excellent contrast and accessibility compliance.
- All colors named and hex codes documented for ease of use in projects.

## Typography
- **Inter** typeface for optimal readability on screens, licensed for open use.
- Headline and Body styles structured for both desktop and mobile, making responsive design effortless.

## Planned Components
- Navigation drawers and theme toggles (CSS-only for now)
- Cards, buttons, and form elements coming soon
- Future JavaScript-powered interactivity (live previews, theme switching, etc.)
